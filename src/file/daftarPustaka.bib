After a brief orientation toward concepts and notation, the reader is introduced to group algebras, endomorphism algebras, matrix algebras, and quaternion algebras. Along the way, there is a brief digression, which contains a hint of the connection between algebraic geometry and the theory of finite dimensional algebras over a field.",
